National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding 2012
======================

On December 19, President Obama signed the National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding (NSISS). This new National Strategy is part of a policy continuum that includes [Section 1016 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004](http://ise.gov/intelligence-reform-and-terrorism-prevention-act-2004-sec-1016-information-sharing), the [2007 National Strategy for Information Sharing](http://ise.gov/sites/default/files/nsis_book_0.pdf), Executive Orders [13587](https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/10/13/2011-26729/structural-reforms-to-improve-the-security-of-classified-networks-and-the-responsible-sharing-and) and [13388](https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2005/10/27/05-21571/further-strengthening-the-sharing-of-terrorism-information-to-protect-americans), the ISE Presidential Guidelines, and the [National Security Strategy](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf).

This National Strategy provides guidance for what we must do to share and safeguard information that enhances national security and protects the safety of the American people. It also addresses more than just terrorism information, because we have learned that it is often impractical, if not impossible, to identify and separate that type of information from others, such as crime, drug, or immigration.
