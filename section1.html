  <h1><a href="#section-0" id="section-0">THE WHITE HOUSE<br/>WASHINGTON</a></h1>

<p>As President, I have no greater responsibility than ensuring the safety and security of the United States and the American people. Meeting this responsibility requires the closest possible cooperation among our intelligence, military, diplomatic, homeland security, law enforcement, and public health communities, as well as with our partners at the State and local level and in the private sector. This cooperation, in turn, demands the timely and effective sharing of intelligence and information about threats to our Nation with those who need it, from the President to the police officer on the street.</p>

<p>Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, we have seen great improvement in information sharing. Today, our analysts, investigators, and public safety professionals are sharing more information and cooperating more effectively than ever before. Unfortunately, we also have had instances when critical information was not shared quickly or widely enough, or when unauthorized disclosures of classified and sensitive information damaged our national security.</p>

<p>This <em>National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding (Strategy)</em> aims to strike the proper balance between sharing information with those who need it to keep our country safe and safeguarding it from those who would do us harm. While these two priorities&mdash;sharing and safeguarding&mdash;are often seen as mutually exclusive, in reality they are mutually reinforcing. This Strategy, therefore, emphasizes how strengthening the protection of classified and sensitive information can help to build confidence and trust so that such information can be shared with authorized users.</p>

<p>This Strategy recognizes this vital information for what it is—a national asset that must be both protected and shared, as appropriate. The threats to our national security are constantly evolving, so our policies to ensure this information is used and protected as intended must evolve as well. This includes protecting private and personal information about United States persons and upholding our commitment to transparency. This Strategy makes it clear that the individual privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties of United States persons must be&mdash;and will be&mdash;protected.</p>

<p>Our national security depends on sharing the right information with the right people at the right time. We will therefore keep working to maintain an environment in which information is shared in a manner that is responsible, seamless, and secure. Guided by this Strategy, we will continue to leverage critical information to keep our Nation secure and our fellow citizens safe.</p>
  
  <h2><a href="#section-1" id="section-1">Executive Summary</a></h2>
  
<p>Our national security depends on our ability to share the right information, with the right people, at the right time. This information sharing mandate requires sustained and responsible collaboration between Federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, private sector, and foreign partners. Over the last few years, we have successfully streamlined policies and processes, overcome cultural barriers, and better integrated information systems to enable information sharing. Today’s dynamic operating environment,
however, challenges us to continue improving information sharing and safeguarding processes and capabilities. While innovation has enhanced our ability to share, increased sharing has created the potential for vulnerabilities requiring strengthened safeguarding practices. The 2012 National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding provides guidance for effective development, integration, and implementation of policies, processes, standards, and technologies to promote secure and responsible information sharing.</p>

<p>Our responses to these challenges must be strategic and grounded in three core principles. First, in treating Information as a National Asset, we recognize departments and agencies have achieved an unprecedented ability to gather, store, and use information consistent with their missions and applicable legal authorities; correspondingly they have an obligation to make that information available to support
national security missions. Second, our approach recognizes Information Sharing and Safeguarding Requires Shared Risk Management. In order to build and sustain the trust required to share with one another, we must work together to identify and collectively reduce risk, rather than avoiding information loss by not sharing at all. Third, the core premise Information Informs Decisionmaking underlies all our actions and reminds us better decisionmaking is the purpose of sharing information in the first place. The Strategy focuses on achieving five goals:</p>
  
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Drive Collective Action through Collaboration and Accountability.</strong> We can best reach our shared vision when working together, using governance models that enable mission achievement,
adopting common processes where possible to build trust, simplifying the information sharing agreement development process, and supporting efforts through performance management,
training, and incentives.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Improve Information Discovery and Access through Common Standards.</strong> Improving discovery and access involves developing clear policies for making information available to approved individuals. Secure discovery and access relies on identity, authentication, and authorization
controls, data tagging, enterprise-wide data correlation, common information sharing standards, and a rigorous process to certify and validate their use.    </li>
<li>
        <strong>
Optimize Mission Effectiveness through Shared Services and Interoperability.</strong> Efforts to optimize mission effectiveness include shared services, data and network interoperability, and increased efficiency in acquisition.    </li>
<li>
        <strong>
Strengthen Information Safeguarding through Structural Reform, Policy, and Technical Solutions.</strong> To foster trust and safeguard our information, policies and coordinating bodies must focus on identifying, preventing, and mitigating insider threats and external intrusions, while departments and agencies work to enhance capabilities for data-level controls, automated monitoring, and cross-classification solutions.    </li>
<li>
        <strong>
Protect Privacy, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties through Consistency and Compliance.</strong> Integral to maintaining the public trust is increasing the consistency by which we apply privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties protections across the government, building corresponding safeguards
into the development of information sharing operations, and promoting accountability and compliance mechanisms.    </li>
    
</ol>
  
  <p>As we execute the Strategy together, we will harness our collective resolve to treat information as a national asset, make it discoverable and retrievable by all authorized users, and arm those charged with preserving the security of our Nation. Only as we work together, hold ourselves accountable, and take concerted ownership of advancing our goals, will we achieve the safety and success our country rightfully demands and fully deserves.</p>
  
  
<h2><a href="#section-2" id="section-2">I. Introduction</a></h2>
  
  <em>To prevent acts of terrorism on American soil, we must enlist all of our intelligence, law enforcement, and homeland security capabilities. We will continue to integrate and leverage state and major urban area fusion centers that have the capability to share classified information; establish a nationwide framework for reporting suspicious activity; and implement an integrated approach to our counterterrorism information systems to ensure that the analysts, agents, and officers who protect us have access to all relevant intelligence throughout the government. We are improving information sharing and cooperation by linking networks to facilitate Federal, state, and local capabilities to seamlessly exchange messages and information, conduct searches, and collaborate.</em>
  <br/>&mdash; National Security Strategy, May 2010</p>
  
  <p>Our national security relies on our ability to share the right information, with the right people, at the right time. As the world becomes an increasingly networked place, addressing the challenges to national security—foreign and domestic—requires sustained collaboration and responsible information sharing. The imperative to secure and protect the American public is a partnership shared at all levels including Federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial. Partnerships and collaboration must occur within and among intelligence, defense, diplomatic, homeland security, law enforcement, and private sector communities.</p>
  
<h3><a href="#section-2a" id="section-2a">Scope</a></h3>
<p>Anchored on the 2010 National Security Strategy, the 2012 National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding (hereafter referred to as the Strategy) provides guidance for more effective integration and implementation of policies, processes, standards, and technologies to promote secure and responsible national security information sharing.</p>

<p>The Strategy does not define particular categories or types of information that must be shared. Rather, it shifts the focus of information sharing and safeguarding policy to defining information requirements that support effective decisionmaking. The Strategy outlines a vision with a national policy roadmap to guide information sharing and safeguarding within existing law and policy. This Strategy does not replace the National Strategy for Information Sharing (2007 NSIS), as the 2007 NSIS continues to provide a policy framework and directs many core initiatives intended to improve information sharing. This Strategy will continue to highlight appropriate protection of individual rights—privacy and civil liberties are most relevant in this context. Nonetheless, departments and agencies must never lose sight of their responsibility to protect the civil rights of all Americans in accordance with their respective authorities.</p>

<h3><a href="#section-2b" id="section-2b">Vision</a></h3>

<p>It is a national priority to efficiently, effectively, and appropriately share and safeguard information so any authorized individual (Federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, private sector or foreign partner) can prevent harm to the American people and protect national security. The Strategy points toward a futurein which information supports national security decisionmaking by providing the right information, at any time, to any authorized user, restricted only by law or policy, not technology; and where safeguarding measures, to include a comprehensive regimen of accountability, prevent the misuse of the information.</p>
